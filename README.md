This is simple ETL pipeline based on data from TMDB (The Movie DataBase)

An ETL pipeline is data engineering workflow which consist of getting unstructured or diffciult to access data and serve this data in clean or structure format.

unstrructured data -> ETL -> structure data

We would be using the following libraries

- Request
- Pandas

Our home directory is pipe.py and we would use the config.py for our API keys

Step to run on you local machine.

- Clone repository to your local machine
- Open in editor of your choice
- Create a file called config.py and assign you API keys to API_KEYS = ''
- Register on TMDB (developers.themoviedb.org) to get your API keys
- Run code
